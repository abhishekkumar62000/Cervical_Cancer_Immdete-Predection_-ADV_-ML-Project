# 🎗️ Cervical Cancer Immediate Prediction - ADV ML Project 🎗️

Welcome to the **Cervical Cancer Immediate Prediction - Advanced Machine Learning Project**! 🏥  
This project is focused on predicting **cervical cancer risk** using **machine learning models** based on medical and lifestyle-related features. The goal is to help in **early diagnosis** and improve preventive healthcare measures. 🩺  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

Today, I built a **Cervical Cancer Immediate Prediction Model** using **Python** and **ML techniques** to analyze health data and predict the risk of cervical cancer. 🧬  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** 📊  
- **NumPy** 🔢  
- **Matplotlib** 📉  
- **Seaborn** 🌈  
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖  
- **XGBoost** 🌱  
- **SMOTE (for imbalance handling)** ⚖️  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 💻  

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** 🧼  
   - Imported dataset and performed initial cleaning.  
   - Handled missing values using **mean/mode imputation**.  

2. **Data Visualization** 🎨  
   - Plotted **histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps** 🔥.  
   - Analyzed relationships between features like **age, lifestyle, and medical history**.  

3. **Outlier Detection** ⚠️  
   - Identified and handled **outliers** using **IQR method & Z-score analysis**.  

---

## 🔍 Feature Engineering  
1. **Feature Selection** ✂️  
   - Used **correlation analysis** and **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to select the most important features.  

2. **Feature Encoding** 🔡  
   - Converted categorical data using **one-hot encoding & label encoding**.  

3. **Data Balancing** ⚖️  
   - Handled **class imbalance** using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.  

---

## 🏗️ Machine Learning Model Development  
1. **Model Selection** 🔍  
   - Implemented multiple ML models for comparison:  
     - **Logistic Regression** ⚖️  
     - **Random Forest** 🌳  
     - **XGBoost** 🚀  
     - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** 🎯  

2. **Model Evaluation** 📈  
   - Evaluated models using:  
     - **Accuracy** ✅  
     - **Precision & Recall** 📊  
     - **F1-score** 🎯  
     - **ROC-AUC Curve** 📉  

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning** 🔧  
   - Used **GridSearchCV** for optimizing model parameters for better performance.  

---

## 🏆 Results & Findings  
- **XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy of 87%** 🏅.  
- The model can assist doctors in predicting **cervical cancer risk in real-time** 🏥.  
- The prediction model helps in early detection and can save lives through timely intervention.
